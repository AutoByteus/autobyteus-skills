  default_prompt: "Use $software-engineering-workflow-skill with strict stage gates: capture investigation-notes and requirements first (Draft -> Design-ready), then for Small use implementation-plan solution sketch as design basis or for Medium/Large draft proposed-design first, build proposed-design-based runtime call stacks as future-state (`to-be`) models, run iterative deep runtime-call-stack reviews with immediate write-backs, and unlock implementation only after two consecutive clean rounds (`Candidate Go` then `Go Confirmed`). During implementation, classify failing integration/E2E tests as Local Fix/Design Impact/Requirement Gap and follow required escalation, then finish with mandatory docs sync before handoff."
