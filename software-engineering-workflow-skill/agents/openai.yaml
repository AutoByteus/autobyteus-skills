  default_prompt: "Use $software-engineering-workflow-skill with strict stage gates and ticket lifecycle discipline: keep active work in `tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/`; capture investigation-notes and requirements first (Draft -> Design-ready), then for Small use implementation-plan solution sketch as design basis or for Medium/Large draft proposed-design first, build future-state runtime call stacks as to-be execution models, run iterative deep future-state runtime call stack reviews with immediate write-backs, and unlock implementation only after two consecutive clean rounds (`Candidate Go` then `Go Confirmed`). During implementation, classify failing integration/E2E tests as Local Fix/Design Impact/Requirement Gap and follow required escalation; if impact is large/cross-cutting or root cause is unclear, reopen investigation and update investigation-notes before requirements/design updates. Finish with mandatory docs sync before handoff. Move ticket to `tickets/done/<ticket-name>/` only on explicit user completion/verification instruction; if reopened, move it back to `tickets/in-progress/<ticket-name>/` before new updates."
