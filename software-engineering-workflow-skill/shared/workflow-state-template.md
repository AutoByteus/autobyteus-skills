# Workflow State

Use this file as the mandatory stage-control artifact for the ticket.
Update this file before every stage transition and before any source-code edit.
Stage movement is controlled by this file's Stage Transition Contract + Transition Matrix.

## Current Snapshot

- Ticket:
- Current Stage: `0` / `1` / `2` / `3` / `4` / `5` / `6` / `7` / `8` / `9` / `10`
- Next Stage:
- Code Edit Permission: `Locked` / `Unlocked`
- Active Re-Entry: `No` / `Yes`
- Re-Entry Classification (`Local Fix`/`Validation Gap`/`Design Impact`/`Requirement Gap`/`Unclear`): `N/A`
- Last Transition ID:
- Last Updated:

## Stage 0 Bootstrap Record

- Bootstrap Mode (`Git`/`Non-Git`):
- User-Specified Base Branch:
- Resolved Base Remote:
- Resolved Base Branch:
- Default Finalization Target Remote:
- Default Finalization Target Branch:
- Remote Refresh Performed (`Yes`/`No`/`N/A`):
- Remote Refresh Result:
- Ticket Worktree Path:
- Ticket Branch:

Note:
- Fill this record during Stage 0 and keep it current if Stage 0 is reopened.
- Unless the user explicitly overrides Stage 10 later, the default finalization target should match the resolved base remote/branch recorded here.
- For non-git projects, mark git-only fields as `N/A`.

## Stage Transition Contract (Quick Reference)

| Stage | Exit Condition | On Fail/Blocked |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Bootstrap complete, base-branch/worktree decision recorded, and `requirements.md` is `Draft` | stay in `0` |
| 1 | `investigation-notes.md` current + scope triage recorded | stay in `1` |
| 2 | `requirements.md` is `Design-ready`/`Refined` | stay in `2` |
| 3 | Design basis current for scope | stay in `3` |
| 4 | Future-state runtime call stack current | stay in `4` |
| 5 | Future-state runtime call stack review `Go Confirmed` (two clean rounds with no blockers/no required persisted artifact updates/no newly discovered use cases) | classified re-entry then rerun (`Design Impact`: `3 -> 4 -> 5`, `Requirement Gap`: `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, `Unclear`: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`) |
| 6 | Source + required unit/integration verification complete, shared design/common-practice rules are reapplied during implementation, no backward-compatibility/legacy-retention paths remain in scope, dead/obsolete code cleanup in scope is complete, ownership-driven dependencies remain valid (no new unjustified cycles/tight coupling), touched files sit in the correct folder under the correct owning subsystem, and changed source implementation files have proactive Stage 8 size/delta-pressure handling recorded (`>500` avoided, `>220` assessed/acted on) | local issues: stay in `6`; otherwise classified re-entry (`Design Impact`: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`, `Requirement Gap`: `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`, `Unclear`: `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`) |
| 7 | API/E2E gate closes all executable mapped acceptance criteria (`Passed` or explicit user `Waived`) and all relevant executable spines have passing scenario evidence (or explicit `N/A` rationale) | `Blocked` on infeasible/no waiver; otherwise classified re-entry |
| 8 | Code review gate decision is `Pass` with all changed source files `<=500` effective non-empty lines, required `>220` delta-gate assessments recorded, and data-flow spine inventory/ownership/off-spine concern checks + existing-capability reuse + reusable-owned-structure extraction + shared-structure/data-model tightness + shared-base coherence + repeated-coordination ownership + empty-indirection + scope-appropriate separation of concerns + file placement within the correct subsystem and folder, with any optional module grouping justified + flat-vs-over-split layout judgment + interface/API/query/command/service-method boundary clarity + naming quality across files/folders/APIs/types/functions/parameters/variables + naming-to-responsibility alignment + no unjustified duplication of code/repeated structures in changed scope + patch-on-patch complexity control + dead/obsolete code cleanup completeness in changed scope + test quality + test maintainability + validation-evidence sufficiency + no-backward-compat/no-legacy checks satisfied | classified re-entry then rerun |
| 9 | `docs-sync.md` is current and docs are updated or no-impact rationale is recorded | classify and re-enter when docs cannot yet be made truthful (`Local Fix`: `6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9`, `Requirement Gap`: `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9`, `Unclear`: `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9`); otherwise stay in `9` only for external docs blockers |
| 10 | `handoff-summary.md` is current, explicit user completion/verification is received, the ticket is moved to `tickets/done/<ticket-name>/`, and, when git repo, repository finalization is complete, any applicable release/publication/deployment step is complete or explicitly recorded as not required, and required post-finalization worktree/branch cleanup is complete when applicable | stay in `10` |

| Stage 6 failure (`Design Impact`) | `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6` | Fail |
| Stage 6 failure (`Requirement Gap`) | `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6` | Fail |

| Stage 7 failure (`Unclear`/cross-cutting root cause) | `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7` | Fail |
| Stage 7 infeasible criteria without explicit user waiver | stay in `7` | Blocked |
| Stage 8 failure (`Local Fix`) | `6 -> 7 -> 8` | Fail |
| Stage 8 failure (`Validation Gap`) | `7 -> 8` | Fail |
| Stage 8 failure (`Design Impact`) | `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8` | Fail |
| Stage 8 failure (`Requirement Gap`) | `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8` | Fail |
| Stage 8 failure (`Unclear`/cross-cutting root cause) | `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8` | Fail |
| Stage 9 blocked docs-sync result (`Local Fix`) | `6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9` | Fail |
| Stage 9 blocked docs-sync result (`Requirement Gap`) | `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9` | Fail |
| Stage 9 blocked docs-sync result (`Unclear`) | `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9` | Fail |
| Stage 9 blocked by external docs/access issue only | stay in `9` | Blocked |
| Stage 10 awaiting explicit user verification | stay in `10` | In Progress |
| Stage 10 archival/repository finalization/release-publication-deployment/cleanup blocked | stay in `10` | Blocked |

Note:
- In re-entry paths, Stage 0 means re-open bootstrap controls in the same ticket/worktree (`workflow-state.md`, lock state, artifact baselines); do not create a new ticket folder.
- For Stage 5 failures, record classified re-entry first; then persist artifact updates in the returned upstream stage before running the next Stage 5 round.
- Stage 10 can remain `In Progress` while waiting for explicit user completion/verification before moving the ticket to `done` and starting repository finalization.
- After repository finalization is complete, Stage 10 may still remain `Blocked` if an applicable release/publication/deployment step fails or is undocumented.
- After repository finalization and any applicable release/publication/deployment work are complete, Stage 10 may still remain `Blocked` until required ticket-worktree/local-branch cleanup is complete when a dedicated ticket worktree/branch exists.

## Pre-Edit Checklist (Stage 6 Source-Code Edits)

- Current Stage is `6`: `Yes` / `No`
- Code Edit Permission is `Unlocked`: `Yes` / `No`
- Stage 5 gate is `Go Confirmed`: `Yes` / `No`
- Required upstream artifacts are current: `Yes` / `No`
- Pre-Edit Checklist Result: `Pass` / `Fail`
- If `Fail`, source code edits are prohibited.

## Re-Entry Declaration

- Trigger Stage (`5`/`6`/`7`/`8`):
- Classification (`Local Fix`/`Validation Gap`/`Design Impact`/`Requirement Gap`/`Unclear`):
- Required Return Path:
- Required Upstream Artifacts To Update Before Code Edits:
- Resume Condition:

Note:
- Transition/Re-entry completion rule: recording the path is not enough; resume work immediately and treat re-entry as incomplete until work has actually resumed in the returned stage.
- Default resume condition: `Resume immediately into the first returned stage, without waiting for another user message, unless blocked or waiting on an explicit user-only gate. Re-entry is not complete until work has actually resumed in that returned stage.`
- Stage 5 re-entry normally uses `Design Impact` / `Requirement Gap` / `Unclear` only (not `Local Fix`).
- Stage 6 re-entry uses `Local Fix` (stay in `6`) or non-local classified return path (`Design Impact`/`Requirement Gap`/`Unclear`) before further source edits.
- Stage 9 blocked docs sync uses `Local Fix` / `Requirement Gap` / `Unclear` when docs cannot yet be made truthful; stay in `9` only for external docs blockers that do not require upstream artifact changes.
- Stage 8 may use `Validation Gap` when the main issue is insufficient Stage 7 coverage/evidence rather than code or design drift.
